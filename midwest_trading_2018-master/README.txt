The file with all our strategy code is: 

midwest_cmu_strategy.py

Run this on the terminal:
python3 </location> midwest_cmu_strategy.py

The requirements.txt file contains all the packages that our code needs.

We have another support python file (Please do not delete it):
- cmu_strategy_predict.py

and also preloaded data files/folders (Please do not delete this as well):
- ind_rank
- models

We understand that portfolio.py will be overwritten. Please update the portfolio.py file with your implementation.
